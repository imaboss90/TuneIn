**Created by Israel Yarce and Ryan Walentowicz**

**Initial Mock-up:** https://www.figma.com/file/v9FxaLojjlpsP3e3gX0Lrp/TuneIn?type=design&mode=design&t=NFxfiYEdf3u6NEev-1

**Project Overview**

TuneIn is a cutting-edge music discovery application tailored for those with a passion for sharing and exploring new songs, inspired by the app BeReal. It's not just about personal music tastes, but also about delving deeper into the vast realm of music. Engage with friends, leave comments, and spark real-world music discussions, all through TuneIn.

**Key Features**
- Login and Sign-Up: Reliable authentication for both newcomers and returning users.
- Home Screen: A vibrant feed of posts from you and your friends, complete with likes and comments. Plus, quick-access buttons for profiles, searching users, and making new posts.
- New Post Screen: Share your latest tune with an accompanying caption, the song's cover art, and broadcast it to the community.
- User Account Screen: A personal hub for browsing your history, tweaking settings, and more.
- Sign Out Screen: Always double-checking to ensure you really want to log out.

**Design Philosophy**
Simplicity meets elegance. Taking cues from giants like Instagram and BeReal, the UI is sculpted to be straightforward and familiar. A harmonious color palette further elevates the user experience.

**Achievements and Goals**
Beginning as novices in React Native, Firebase, and APIs, our maiden goal was a functional home screen. However, our swift progress led to ambitions of Firebase-backed authentication and Spotify API synergy. The mission? A smooth-sailing user journey, especially for those used to similar platforms.

**Inspirations**
BeReal's spontaneous photo-sharing ethos lit the spark. The dream? An app dedicated to music. The design DNA? A mix of Instagram and Facebook, cherry-picking their finest to birth TuneIn's identity.

**Technologies Used**
- Firebase Authentication: For airtight user sign-ins and registrations.
- FireStore: Our trusted NoSQL database for all things user data, posts, and friendships.
- RandomUser API: For those spiffy random user avatars.
- Spotify API: A future integration to fetch song specifics and meld TuneIn accounts with Spotify.
- Formik: Our toolkit for robust in-app forms.
- Yup: In tandem with Formik, it ensures pristine value parsing and validation.
- React.js: The backbone of TuneIn's vivid interface.
